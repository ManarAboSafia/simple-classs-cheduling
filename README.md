# simple-classs-cheduling
In this project you are asked to implement a simple class scheduling application

In	this	project	you	are	asked	to	implement	a	simple	class	scheduling	applica6on	by	using	Java	.	
Your	applica6on	should	accomplish	the	following	tasks: 
1. Firstly,	the	program	displays	a	Welcoming	message.	
2. Secondly,	your	program	displays	op6ons	form	for	a	user	to	choose	from,	like	the	following:	
a. Create	Schedule	form	.
b. Display	Schedule	form	.
c. Modify	Schedule	form.		
d. Delete	Schedule	form.	
e. Exit .  
Create	Schedule	:  	
1. Choosing	Create	Schedule,	the	program	display	form	asks	a	user	to	enter	student’s	informa6on	[ﬁrst	name,	last	name,	student	ID	,student	Level	and	collage]		and	course	informa6on	[course	name,	course	number,	course	hall	and	course	teacher]		and	the		program	show	two	choice	(create	or	cancel	).	when	user	select	cancel	the	program		must	exit	current	form	and	show	main	op6ons	.	
2.	if	user	select	create,	your	program	should	display	form	to	ask	a	user	to	select	course	days.		Days	are	Sat,	Sun,	Mon,	Tue,	Wed,	Thu,	and	Fri.	(two	or	three	days	can	be	chosen	at	most)	.	
3.	If	a	user	chose	Thu	or	Fri,	your	program	should	show	him/her	a	conﬁrma6on	message.	Because	Thursdays	and	Fridays	are	unusual	lectures	days.		
a. If	the	user	conﬁrmed,	then	he/she	can	enter	class	6mes	in	Thursday	or	Friday.	b.
b.	If	a	user	declines,	then	the	program	asks	him/her	to	choose	another	day.	
4.	Then,	the	program	should	show	the	hours	of	the	ﬁrst	chosen	day,	for	the	user	to	ﬁll	class	6mes	in	this	day.	[hours	are:	8-9,	9-10	,	10-11	,	….	3-4]		
5. When	the	user	ﬁnishes	entering	class	schedule	for	the	ﬁrst	course	,	the	program	asks	if	the	user	wishes	to	enter	another	course	class	6mes.	
6. If	no	more	courses	are	to	be	added,	a	user	is	shown	op6ons	form:	display,	modify,	delete,	and	create	another	student’s	schedule.  
Display	Schedule:	
1. Choosing	the	display	op6on:	
a. Your	program	should	display	student	schedule	on	the	screen.	It	must	be	a	well-organized	schedule	showing	classes	6mes	at	the	speciﬁed	days.(i.e.	it	has	a	table	format )
Modify	Schedule:  
1. Choosing	the	modify	op6on	form:  	
a. The	program	show	modiﬁca6on	form	and	ask	about	days	and	6mes	of	modiﬁca6on.	
b. Then,	a	user	enters	modiﬁca6ons	like:	day	6me	course
c. Entering	modiﬁca6ons	is	repeated	un6l	a	user	chooses	that	no	more	modiﬁca6ons	are	to	be	added		
d. At	the	end,	the	modiﬁed	schedule	is	displayed		
Delete	Schedule:  	
Choosing	the	delete	op6on:		
Display	entered	schedule	and	choose	delete	bu_on	a	conﬁrma6on	message	will	be	displayed:	
a. A	Yes	answer	deletes	the	schedule	
b. A	No	answer	makes	you	program	show	op6ons	form;	display,	modify,	delete,	create	another	student’s	schedule	and	exit.		
1-	Choosing	the	create	another	student’s	schedule	op6on:	
a. This	would	cause	the	process	to	be	repeated	again	for	the	new	student.
2. If	the	user	decided	not	to	enter	a	schedule	for	another	student,	the	program	exits	displaying	a	farewell	message.	
3. For	points	4	and	5	in	Create	Schedule	,	your	program	must	handle	class	conﬂicts,	by:	
	a.	Sugges6ng	other	free	6mes	(days	and	hours)	of	the	week.		
	b.	If	a	user	insisted	and	did	not	change	his	conﬂic6ng	choices,	your	program	should	allow	him	to	modify	previously	scheduled	classes	and	it	warns	him/her	that	what	he/she	is	doing	will	cancel	already	scheduled	classes		
4. your	program	must		prints	the	ﬁnal	table	of	any	student	to	a	console	.
